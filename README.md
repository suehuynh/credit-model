# Home Credit Kaggle 2024 submission
*Author : Sue Huynh*

*Date : February 2024*

Welcome and thank you for visiting my work on the Home Credit 2024 competition!

**About the competition** - "The goal of this competition is to determine how likely a customer is going to default on an issued loan. The main difference between the first and this competition is that now your submission will be scored with a custom metric that will take into account how well the model performs in future. A decline in performance will be penalized. The goal is to create a model that is stable and performs well in the future." (quoted from [Starter notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/jetakow/home-credit-2024-starter-notebook))

**About my submission** - Inspired by the Starter Notebook, I will
* Join tables with Polars - a DataFrame library implemented in Rust language, designed to be blazingy fast and memory efficient.
* Create simple aggregation features
* Train a LightGBM model
* Hypertune parameters using BayesSearchCV
